# Bus-Reservasion-System
"My Bus Reservation System project is a full-stack project. It is a fully working project where bus reservations
are successfully made, receipts are generated, payments are processed, and real-time bus timings can be searched.
The website is fully functional. I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL in this project."
